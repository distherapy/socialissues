'''
simple maths/data to solve these social issues:

- water > bottled water is sold while many have no clean water
- food > we throw away 40% of edible food, most grain is to feed our food
- shelter > more empty homes than homeless, yet new buildings are constructed daily

and thereby solving much social divisiveness based on the bonobos/chimps divergence.

this is from the perspective of a person trapped in the geographic corporate region called the united states.

this should also spotlight the primitive, depraved, and/or submissive human behaviors of:

- selling/marketing basic needs (dehumanization for profit)
- serving masters selfishly so YOUR basic needs are met and they leave you alone while it binds others in your caste
- letting corporate masters promise you 'solutions' with your money
- <i>still</i> letting corporate masters promise you 'solutions' with your money
- <strong>STILL</strong> letting corporate masters promise you 'solutions' with your money
- not understanding that they trade your cheap labor with one another
- not understanding that 'money' is the arbitrary unit your hour of cheap labor is worth to them
- buying excess garbage that is not necessary existentially
- wasteful travel(trips, modding verhicles, wasting energy)
- fast food instead of growing food, mowing lawns instead of growing food
